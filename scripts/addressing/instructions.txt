Addressing, Memory Segments, etc.
In this homework, you’ll confirm your understanding of the memory
segments in a process. You’ll have to develop a C program on your own
for it.
You will have several files. Please put them in a .tgz or .zip file,
no other file formats will be accepted!
Incude a README.txt file that tells me what files are included and
what they are, e.g. which of the four problems below they are the
answer to.
1. Print out a pointer to a local variable inside a function.
2. Use recursion and print out the addresses of local variables. Does
the stack on your system grow up or down?
3. Print some pointers to some global variables. Have some be
initialized at compile time, some not.
4. Print some pointers to functions.
5. malloc() some memory and print a pointer to it.
6. Can you find a process address space map, and determine which
segments local variables, global variables, functions, and malloced
memory belong to?
For all of the above, include both your source code and the output!
If you have only one program that does all of it, that’s okay, please
tell me in the README.txt you include.
